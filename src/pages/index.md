Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition (IGWC) is a member-run labor union representing over 1,700 graduate workers and students at Indiana University, Bloomington.

Since 2019, we've secured better pay, better working conditions, secured 



fought for pay, rights, and the basic dignity of graduate workers at IU. 

 We began by organizing against the exorbitant student fees, which ultimately culminated in a fee strike in spring 2021; over 800 graduate students witheld their student fees from the university. In 2021, the IGWC affiliated with UE and signed over 1600 graduate workers. When the university refused to recognize the union in spring 2022, over 1000 graduate workers went on strike for four weeks.
When we announced our plan to continue our strike in the fall, IU raised the minimum stipend and eliminated the student fees. 

In fall 2023, the IGWC demanded union recognition and a living wage. Yet again, IU refused to come to the table, so in spring 2024, we agitated for a "no confidence vote" in IU administration for failing to recognize our union which IU faculty passed with over 90% in favor, and we went on strike for 3 days.
