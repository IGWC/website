# NOTES

- [File Imports](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#file-imports-vs-content-collections-queries) might enable remote editing of content? is vscode a better option?
- move newsletter and make it editable through astro
	- this would just require a template with the archaic markup. 
- make stickers dynamic (add up to 4 stickers)
	- make stickers movable/position absolute
	


## Plugins:
